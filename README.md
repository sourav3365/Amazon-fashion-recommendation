# Amazon-fashion-recommendation
Recommending amazon fashion products using text vectorizer techniques and K-Means algorithm and transfer learning. In this case study similarity between any two or more products is governed by the euclidean distance between them.

1. Use the top_fashion.rar file for traning/testing models
2. The Preparing data folder contain three ".ipynb" files
3. The "Amazon preparing data" file contains loading and testing and visualzing the data
4. The "Pre processing and recommendation model" file contains pre-processing the data and  text vectorizer techniques and K_Means algorithm implementation to recommened products
5. The "Transfer_learning_model" contains feature extraction using VGG-16 pre tranined model (I recommend using google collaboratory to run this file, i could not perform feature extraction on my system with 8GB RAM and NVDIA 940MX GPU)
